Hotel Management System、Suitable for hotels, restaurants, small shops
您好，我的朋友，我设计了一款扫码点餐小程序，如果您或身边人是一个小店主的话，可能会很高兴拥有它，它能够轻松高效地处理客户订单，节省人力物力成本，尤其对一些不善于与人打交道的老板们来说，下面我来详细的介绍一下他的功能。
Hello, my friend, I have designed a small program for ordering food by scanning codes. If you or someone around you is a small shop owner, you may be happy to have it. It can process customer orders easily and efficiently, saving manpower and material costs. Especially for some bosses who are not good at dealing with people, let me introduce its functions in detail below.
首先给您展示客户端，在这里我们的客人可以通过扫描二维码进行点单，我们可以看到，这里有很多的商品，客户可以选择各类的商品然后下单，如有特殊需求，还可以在下面渐入框进行备注留言 
First, let me show you the client. Here, our customers can place orders by scanning the QR code. We can see that there are many products here. Customers can choose various products and place orders. If there are special needs, you can also leave a note in the box below.
您刚刚一定很好奇，那些商品不是我卖的主要商品，该怎么设置成我卖的商品呢？下面就让我介绍一下我们的系统管理端，进到我们系统端，映入眼帘的就有一个商品管理的功能区，点击这个功能区下面的商品管理，即可对我们的商品进行编辑，您可以在这里设置您售卖的商品，包括介绍、单价、特点等等
You must be very curious about how to set those products that are not my main products to be my products? Let me introduce our system management terminal. When you enter our system terminal, you will see a product management function area. Click on the product management under this function area to edit our products. You can set the products you sell here, including introduction, unit price, features, etc.
那如果您是一个超大门店，有很多房间或者很多桌，您可以来到管理端门店管理，这里可以对您的房间、桌子等等各系载客空间进行编辑，您可以设置它的价格、特点描述、名称、简照等等，以便客户了解并热爱选择它，配置完成后点击生成二维码，客户就可以通过扫描进行点单了，您的商业之旅就正式赚钱了
If you are a super large store with many rooms or tables, you can go to the management end to manage the store, where you can edit your rooms, tables and other passenger spaces. You can set its price, feature description, name, photo, etc., so that customers can understand and love to choose it. After the configuration is completed, click to generate a QR code, and customers can place an order by scanning. Your business journey will officially make money.
作为一个管理者，肯定要洞悉自己的员工信息，那门店管理里面还有一个员工管理，在这里我们可以对员工的一些信息进行管理，这些信息包括名称、照片、籍贯、薪资、主要技能、紧急联系人等等，通过这些信息，这些信息很重要，能够确定给员工涨薪、员工失联等等关键时刻帮助我们作出选择，高效地管理员工
As a manager, you must have insight into your employee information. There is also an employee management in store management, where we can manage some employee information, including name, photo, place of origin, salary, main skills, emergency contact, etc. Through this information, which is very important, we can determine whether to give employees a salary increase, employees lose contact, etc. At critical moments, we can help us make choices and manage employees efficiently.
回到刚才，客户下单完成后，我们的后厨接单会收到一个语音提示，这样我们的后厨人员就可以快马加鞭地为客户准备餐品，制作完成后可点击完成按钮提示前厅服务员取菜送至客户，这将非常高效，无需您的员工陷入麻木等待，无所适从，节省出的时间，您可以制定新的结果目标安排他们
Back to the previous moment, after the customer places an order, our back kitchen will receive a voice prompt, so that our back kitchen staff can prepare the food for the customer as quickly as possible. After the preparation is completed, they can click the completion button to prompt the front office waiter to take the food and send it to the customer. This will be very efficient and will not require your employees to be numb and wait, at a loss. With the time saved, you can set new result goals to arrange them.
客人享用完服务要进行结账，我们可以来到工作台区域，在结账台菜单下可以查看客人点单的具体消费信息，可以为客人打印消费清单，结账完毕的话，点击客户买单，一套完整的客户订单流程完整结束
After the customer has finished the service, they need to check out. We can go to the workbench area and view the specific consumption information of the customer's order under the checkout menu. We can also print a consumption list for the customer. After the checkout is completed, click on the customer to pay, and a complete customer order process is completed.
最后，您肯定想知道自己门店的月度业绩，总收入如何，这里你可以点击老板驾驶舱按钮，这里显示着您门店的主要销售数据、可以看到您的畅销单品、促销活动信息、客户画像等等数据，方便您灵活的作出调整，为下一步日进斗金作出准备
Finally, you must want to know your store's monthly performance and total revenue. Here you can click the Boss Dock button, which will display your store's main sales data, your best-selling items, promotional information, customer portraits and other data, so that you can make flexible adjustments and prepare for the next step of making a fortune.
